## Part 1: This Thing Called Sleep

### Chapter 1: To Sleep...

* Two-thirds of adults sleep less-than 8 hours per day
* Shorter sleep contributes to:
  * Shorter lifespan
  * Physical + mental illness
* Sleep rejuvenates the body + mind

### Chapter 2: Caffeine, Jet Lag, and Melatonin

#### 2 disparate systems determine when to be asleep or awake:

**1. Adenosine:** chemical which accumulates while we are awake
* Produces the urge to sleep
* Caffiene blocks adenosine receptors in the brain

**2. Suprachaismatic necleus:** circadian rhythm is our internal 24-hour clock for day/night
* Starts/stops producing melatonin

### Chapter 3: Defining and Generating Sleep

* **Thalamus:** guards the consciousness brain from external stimulus

#### Humans cycle through 2 disparate sleep states:

1. **NREM:** non-rapid eye movement
2. **REM:** rapid eye movement

#### NREM Sleep

* Occurs early in the sleep process
* Removes irrelevant information from the brain

#### REM Sleep

* Occurs late in the sleep process
* Fortifies relevant information in the brain
* Brain paralyzes the body to dream safely

### Chapter 4: Ape Beds, Dinosaurs, and Napping with Half a Brain

* Different species need different amounts of sleep
  * Humans have a complex nervous system which requires more sleep to maintain
* Sleep during is a balancing act between:
  * Survival during waking state
  * Restoration + maintenance of mind + body
* Humans cannot "make up" for lost sleep time

#### Monophasic vs Biphasic Sleep Patterns

* **Monophasic:** a single, long sleep
* **Biphasic:** a single, long sleep (plus a short afternoon nap)

#### Humans are Special

* ~20-25% of human sleep is dedicated to REM sleep
* ~9% of other primates sleep is dedicated to REM sleep

#### Why REM Sleep is Important

* rational control of emotions for socially cooperative relationships
* creativity from associations between unrelated information
