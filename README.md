## Part 1: This Thing Called Sleep

### Chapter 1: To Sleep...

* Two-thirds of adults sleep less-than 8 hours per day
* Shorter sleep contributes to:
  * Shorter lifespan
  * Physical + mental illness
* Sleep rejuvenates the body + mind

### Chapter 2: Caffeine, Jet Lag, and Melatonin

#### 2 disparate systems determine when to be asleep or awake:

**1. Adenosine:** chemical which accumulates while we are awake
* Produces the urge to sleep
* Caffiene blocks adenosine receptors in the brain

**2. Suprachaismatic necleus:** circadian rhythm is our internal 24-hour clock for day/night
* Starts/stops producing melatonin

### Chapter 3: Defining and Generating Sleep

* **Thalamus:** guards the consciousness brain from external stimulus

#### Humans cycle through 2 disparate sleep states:

1. **NREM:** non-rapid eye movement
2. **REM:** rapid eye movement

#### NREM Sleep

* Occurs early in the sleep process
* Removes irrelevant information from the brain

#### REM Sleep

* Occurs late in the sleep process
* Fortifies relevant information in the brain
* Brain paralyzes the body to dream safely

### Chapter 4: Ape Beds, Dinosaurs, and Napping with Half a Brain

* Different species need different amounts of sleep
  * Humans have a complex nervous system which requires more sleep to maintain
* Sleep during is a balancing act between:
  * Survival during waking state
  * Restoration + maintenance of mind + body
* Humans cannot "make up" for lost sleep time

#### Monophasic vs Biphasic Sleep Patterns

* **Monophasic:** a single, long sleep
* **Biphasic:** a single, long sleep (plus a short afternoon nap)

#### Humans are Special

* ~20-25% of human sleep is dedicated to REM sleep
* ~9% of other primates sleep is dedicated to REM sleep

#### Why REM Sleep is Important

* rational control of emotions for socially cooperative relationships
* creativity from associations between unrelated information

### Chapter 5: Changes in Sleep Across the Life Span

* **Synaptogenesis:** creates millions of synapses between neurons
* Unborn babies are awake in the womb for 2-3 hours each day during the final trimester
  * REM sleep is greatest when the brain is under greatest construction
  * A lack of REM sleep in newborns hinders brain development
    * Autistic kids have ~30-50% less REM sleep
  * Alcohol powerfully supresses REM sleep and adversely affects REM sleep quality

#### NREM vs REM Sleep % Ratios

* Changes in deep NREM sleep always proceeds major developmental stages of the brain
  * Newborns: 50% NREM + 50% REM
  * Children: 70% NREM + 30% REM
  * Adults: 80% NREM + 20% REM
* Older folks experience lower sleep quality due to more sleep fragmentation
  * weaker bladders make older folks need to wake up more often to urinate
  * poor memory and poor sleep are tightly coupled
  * poor sleep in older folks is often an overlooked culprit to mental illness

## Part 2: Why Should You Sleep?

### Chapter 6: Your Mother and Shakespeare Knew

* Sleep is mandatory for learning + retention and physical + mental health
  * Each stage of sleep (light NREM, deep NREM, and REM sleep) provide different benefits at different times at night
  * Memory is consolidated from the hippocampus (the mind's short-term memory store) into the neocortex (the mind's long-term memory store) via the slow brainwaves of deep NREM sleep
    * Boosting electrical quality of deep-sleep brainwaves helps with memory + recall
    * Auditory stimulation improves memory by increasing the power of the slow brainwaves
    * Slow rocking increases the depth of deep sleep
* REM sleep removes redundant information in the brain
  * "this is important" vs. "this is irrelevant"
* Muscle memory is brain memory
  * Practice + sleep == improvement
  * Motor memories are shifted to brain circuits below our level of consciousness
    * The brain automates movement routines
    * Playing piano == feeling + flow
  * Sleep spindles place a disportional emphasis on the parts of the brain which have worked the hardest at learning during the day
* Creativity is enhanced by REM sleep which associates disparate information in novel ways to improve problem solving capabilities

### Chapter 7: Too Extreme for the Guinness Book of World Records

* Sleep loss produces physical and mental illness
* Every hour someone in the US dies from a car accident due to fatigue
  * We underestimate our sleep imparements
  * After 16 hours of wakefullness, the brain begins to fail
    * The mind cannot accurately sense sleep deprivation when sleep deprived
* Insufficient sleep leads to bad moods and emotional reactivity
  * The amygdala is overactivated and the brain vascillates between extremes of positive and negative emotions
    * Sleep deprivation in bipolar folks may trigger the disorder
      * Manic state
      * Depressive state
* Lack of sleep increases agression, bullying, and other behavioral problems

### Chapter 8: Cancer, Heart Attacks, and a Shorter Life

* The shorter we sleep, the shorter our lifespan
  * We less sleep we are more likely to have:
    * heart attack
    * calcification of the coronary arteries
    * overactive sympathetic nervous system
      * adversely affects: cortisol, respiration, immune function, blood pressure, heart rate, glucose levels (diabetes), microbiome
      * reproductive systems: testosterone, sperm count, menstral cycles, hormones, organs
      * less leptin (feeling full)
      * more ghrelin (feeling hungry) and endocannabindoids (desire to snack)
* Sleep helps the body battle infection and sickness
  * The immune system activates the sleep system to help the body recover
  * Provides a more powerful antibody response to vaccines

## How and Why We Dream

### Chapter 9: Routinely Psychotic

During REM sleep our mental experiences include:

1. hallucinating
2. delusional
3. disoriented
4. emotionally vacillating (affectively labile)
5. suffering from amnesia

During REM sleep, four main clusters of the brain are up to 30% activate:

1. Visuospational regions at the back of the brain
2. Motor cortex
3. Hippocampus
4. Amygdala and cigulate cortex

During REM sleep, the prefrontal cortex is deactivated.
