## Part 1: This Thing Called Sleep

### Chapter 1: To Sleep...

* Two-thirds of adults sleep less-than 8 hours per day
* Shorter sleep contributes to:
  * Shorter lifespan
  * Physical + mental illness
* Sleep rejuvenates the body + mind

### Chapter 2: Caffeine, Jet Lag, and Melatonin

#### 2 disparate systems determine when to be asleep or awake:

**1. Adenosine:** chemical which accumulates while we are awake
* Produces the urge to sleep
* Caffiene blocks adenosine receptors in the brain

**2. Suprachaismatic necleus:** circadian rhythm is our internal 24-hour clock for day/night
* Starts/stops producing melatonin

### Chapter 3: Defining and Generating Sleep

* **Thalamus:** guards the consciousness brain from external stimulus

#### Humans cycle through 2 disparate sleep states:

1. **NREM:** non-rapid eye movement
2. **REM:** rapid eye movement

#### NREM Sleep

* Occurs early in the sleep process
* Removes irrelevant information from the brain

#### REM Sleep

* Occurs late in the sleep process
* Fortifies relevant information in the brain
* Brain paralyzes the body to dream safely

### Chapter 4: Ape Beds, Dinosaurs, and Napping with Half a Brain

* Different species need different amounts of sleep
  * Humans have a complex nervous system which requires more sleep to maintain
* Sleep during is a balancing act between:
  * Survival during waking state
  * Restoration + maintenance of mind + body
* Humans cannot "make up" for lost sleep time

#### Monophasic vs Biphasic Sleep Patterns

* **Monophasic:** a single, long sleep
* **Biphasic:** a single, long sleep (plus a short afternoon nap)

#### Humans are Special

* ~20-25% of human sleep is dedicated to REM sleep
* ~9% of other primates sleep is dedicated to REM sleep

#### Why REM Sleep is Important

* rational control of emotions for socially cooperative relationships
* creativity from associations between unrelated information

### Chapter 5: Changes in Sleep Across the Life Span

* **Synaptogenesis:** creates millions of synapses between neurons
* Unborn babies are awake in the womb for 2-3 hours each day during the final trimester
  * REM sleep is greatest when the brain is under greatest construction
  * A lack of REM sleep in newborns hinders brain development
    * Autistic kids have ~30-50% less REM sleep
  * Alcohol powerfully supresses REM sleep and adversely affects REM sleep quality

#### NREM vs REM Sleep % Ratios

* Changes in deep NREM sleep always proceeds major developmental stages of the brain
  * Newborns: 50% NREM + 50% REM
  * Children: 70% NREM + 30% REM
  * Adults: 80% NREM + 20% REM
* Older folks experience lower sleep quality due to more sleep fragmentation
  * weaker bladders make older folks need to wake up more often to urinate
  * poor memory and poor sleep are tightly coupled
  * poor sleep in older folks is often an overlooked culprit to mental illness

## Part 2: Why Should You Sleep?

### Chapter 6: Your Mother and Shakespeare Knew

* Sleep is mandatory for learning + retention and physical + mental health
  * Each stage of sleep (light NREM, deep NREM, and REM sleep) provide different benefits at different times at night
  * Memory is consolidated from the hippocampus (the mind's short-term memory store) into the neocortex (the mind's long-term memory store) via the slow brainwaves of deep NREM sleep
    * Boosting electrical quality of deep-sleep brainwaves helps with memory + recall
    * Auditory stimulation improves memory by increasing the power of the slow brainwaves
    * Slow rocking increases the depth of deep sleep
* REM sleep removes redundant information in the brain
  * "this is important" vs. "this is irrelevant"
* Muscle memory is brain memory
  * Practice + sleep == improvement
  * Motor memories are shifted to brain circuits below our level of consciousness
    * The brain automates movement routines
    * Playing piano == feeling + flow
  * Sleep spindles place a disportional emphasis on the parts of the brain which have worked the hardest at learning during the day
* Creativity is enhanced by REM sleep which associates disparate information in novel ways to improve problem solving capabilities

### Chapter 7: Too Extreme for the Guinness Book of World Records

* Sleep loss produces physical and mental illness
* Every hour someone in the US dies from a car accident due to fatigue
  * We underestimate our sleep imparements
  * After 16 hours of wakefullness, the brain begins to fail
    * The mind cannot accurately sense sleep deprivation when sleep deprived
* Insufficient sleep leads to bad moods and emotional reactivity
  * The amygdala is overactivated and the brain vascillates between extremes of positive and negative emotions
    * Sleep deprivation in bipolar folks may trigger the disorder
      * Manic state
      * Depressive state
* Lack of sleep increases agression, bullying, and other behavioral problems

### Chapter 8: Cancer, Heart Attacks, and a Shorter Life

* The shorter we sleep, the shorter our lifespan
  * We less sleep we are more likely to have:
    * heart attack
    * calcification of the coronary arteries
    * overactive sympathetic nervous system
      * adversely affects: cortisol, respiration, immune function, blood pressure, heart rate, glucose levels (diabetes), microbiome
      * reproductive systems: testosterone, sperm count, menstral cycles, hormones, organs
      * less leptin (feeling full)
      * more ghrelin (feeling hungry) and endocannabindoids (desire to snack)
* Sleep helps the body battle infection and sickness
  * The immune system activates the sleep system to help the body recover
  * Provides a more powerful antibody response to vaccines

## Part 3: How and Why We Dream

### Chapter 9: Routinely Psychotic

During REM sleep our mental experiences include:

1. hallucinating
2. delusional
3. disoriented
4. emotionally vacillating (affectively labile)
5. suffering from amnesia

During REM sleep, four main clusters of the brain are up to 30% activate:

1. Visuospational regions at the back of the brain
2. Motor cortex
3. Hippocampus
4. Amygdala and cigulate cortex

During REM sleep, the prefrontal cortex is deactivated.

### Chapter 10: Dreaming as Overnight Therapy

Benefits from REM sleep + dreaming:
1. Emotional and mental health
2. Problem solving and creativity

Noradrenaline is completely shut off during REM sleep and is the brain's anxiety producing chemical equivalent to the body's adrenaline 
* REM sleep is the only time the brain is without noradrenaline
* Emotional memory reactivation occurs when the brain is free from noradrenaline
  * Removes our emotional edginess by dampening emotional reactions

REM sleep helps us to *remember* and *forget*:
1. we remember relevant information
2. we forget irrelevant information and dissolve painful emotional memories
  a. allows us to move forward into new emotional futures
  b. not enslaved by traumatic emotional past

REM sleep helps us to recalibrate the regions of our brain which are responsible for reading and decoding emotional signals from others (especially their facial expressions).
  * Lack of REM sleep results in sub-optimally identifying friends vs. foes
  * REM sleep is mandatory to accurately comprehend the social world
    * May result in inappropriate decisions and actions

### Chapter 11: Dream Creativity and Dream Control

* During REM sleep, the brain is biased towards seeking out the most distance nonobvious links between sets of information
  * When we are awake, we often see a narrow set of all possible memory interrelationships
* REM sleep helps us transform learning into comprehension via relational memory processing
  * The dreaming algorithm cherry picks relevant information from previous learning experiences and associates new experiences with preexisting knowledge
* Lucid dreaming occurs when we are aware we are dreaming
  * Control and manipulate the experience
  * May be next step in human evolution to focus the problem solving capabilities of dreaming

## Part 4: From Sleeping Pills to Society Transformed

### Chapter 12: Things That Go Bump in the Night

Humans function optimally with ~16 hours of wakefulness and ~8 hour of sleep each day.

* **Sumnambulism:** sleep (somnus) disorders
  * Sleepwalking
    * State of mixed consciousness (neither asleep nor awake)
  * Insomnia
    * common triggers are emotional concerns and distress (anxiety)
    * chronic activation of the fight-or-flight response
      * brain cannot "shut down" from worries and rumination
      * recursive loops of emotional programs combined with retrospective and prospective memory loops, keep playing in the mind
  * Narcoleptic
    * Sleep/wake switch exists in the hypothalamus via orexin (a neurotransmitter)
    * Sleep/wake switch is never full on or off

### Chapter 13: iPads, Factory Whistles, and Nightcaps

Five causes of less sleep in modern society:

1. Lightbulbs and LEDs from electronics
  a. even a small amount of light can confuse the suprachiasmatic nucleus to believe it is still day during night
  b. delays the release of melatonin
2. Consistent indoor temperatures via heating/cooling
  a. our bodies evolved outdoors and expect a lower temperature during the night
  b. when our core is colder, we fall asleep faster
3. Caffiene
  a. blocks adenosine receptors
4. Alcohol
  a. framents sleep
  b. suppresses REM sleep
5. Legacy 9 to 5 work schedule (plus commuting)
  a. night owls are forced to wake up earlier than their natural circadian rhythm is tuned for

### Chapter 14: Hurting and Helping Your Sleep

#### Sleeping Pills

* Poor sleep quality is induced via sleeping pills which creates sleep which lacks the largest and deepest brainwaves
* When quitting sleeping pills, rebound insomnia causes many individuals to experience worse sleep than they experienced before trying sleeping pills
* Folks who take sleeping pills are more likely to die and get cancer

#### Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I)

* No LED tech during night time
* Regular sleep and wake times
* Only go to bed when sleepy
* Avoid lying in bed awake for extended periods of time
* Avoid daytime napping
* Reduce dwelling upon negative emotions (anxiety/rumination)
* Remove digital clocks from bedroom (preventing clock watching anxiety)
* Increased physical activity during the daytime
* Avoid going to bed too hungry or too full
